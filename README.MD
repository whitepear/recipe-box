This application is live at: https://whitepear.github.io/projects/react/recipe/app/index.html

A React.js application that allows users to create recipes with an associated list of ingredients. Recipes can be edited and deleted after creation, and are saved within the browser's local storage.

The application architecture is designed around a stateful container component which contains two nested components - one stateful Accordion component and one functional Modal component. The application is responsively-designed and styled with Sass.
